# GameManager Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The `GameManager` class was refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability by extracting responsibilities into focused classes and removing code duplication.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Extracted Constants**

- Created `GAME_CONSTANTS` object to centralize magic numbers
- Extracted `PHASE_TRANSITIONS` configuration for better maintainability
- Constants include: `ANTE_AMOUNT`, `CONTINUE_COST`, `CARDS_PER_HAND`, `ROUND_END_DELAY_MS`

### 2. **Created BettingManager Class**

- Extracted all betting-related logic into a separate `BettingManager` class
- Moved methods: `startBettingPhase`, `handleBettingPhaseCompletion`, `getNextPlayerToAct`, `validateBettingAction`, `continuePlaying`, `fold`
- Improved separation of concerns and testability

### 3. **Created GameStateManager Class**

- Extracted all game state management logic into a separate `GameStateManager` class
- Moved methods: `validateGameState`, `validatePlayerCanJoin`, `validateGameCanStart`, `validatePhaseTransition`, `handlePhaseTimeout`, `shouldEndGame`, `resetGameStateForNewRound`, `cleanupGameState`, `getDealerRotationInfo`
- Centralized phase transition configuration
- Improved state validation and management

### 4. **Created PlayerManager Class**

- Extracted all player-related operations into a separate `PlayerManager` class
- Moved methods: `createPlayer`, `validatePlayerCanJoin`, `addPlayerToGame`, `removePlayerFromGame`, `findPlayer`, `getPlayerOrThrow`, `findGameByPlayerId`, `handlePlayerDisconnect`, `validatePlayersHaveEnoughChips`, `collectAnte`, `dealInitialHands`, `resetPlayerStateForNewRound`, `handleSabaccShiftForPlayers`, `validateCardIndices`, `allPlayersHaveSelected`, `allActivePlayersCompletedImprovement`, `getActivePlayers`, `determineGameWinner`, `awardPotToWinner`
- Centralized player state management and validation
- Improved player operations and game state consistency

### 5. **Created RoundManager Class**

- Extracted all round-related operations into a separate `RoundManager` class
- Moved methods: `startNewRound`, `rollDiceForRound`, `endRound`, `resetForNextRound`, `rotateDealer`, `determineRoundWinner`, `getDealerRotationInfo`, `shouldEndGame`, `shouldEndGameAfterRound`, `validateDealerRotation`
- Centralized round progression and dealer rotation logic
- Improved round management and game flow consistency

### 6. **Extracted Game Creation Logic**

- Created `createNewGame()` method to handle game initialization
- Created `createPlayer()` method to handle player creation
- Reduced complexity in `joinGame()` method

### 7. **Improved Code Organization**

- Removed duplicate phase transition configuration
- Updated all methods to use constants instead of magic numbers
- Delegated betting operations to `BettingManager`
- Delegated state management operations to `GameStateManager`
- Delegated player operations to `PlayerManager`
- Delegated round operations to `RoundManager`

## Benefits

### **Maintainability**

- Constants are centralized and easy to modify
- Betting logic is isolated and can be tested independently
- Game creation logic is reusable

### **Testability**

- `BettingManager` can be unit tested in isolation
- `GameStateManager` can be unit tested in isolation
- `PlayerManager` can be unit tested in isolation
- `RoundManager` can be unit tested in isolation
- Smaller, focused methods are easier to test
- Dependencies are clearly defined
- Comprehensive test coverage for each manager

### **Readability**

- Methods are shorter and more focused
- Constants make the code self-documenting
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Extensibility**

- New betting features can be added to `BettingManager`
- New state management features can be added to `GameStateManager`
- New player features can be added to `PlayerManager`
- New round features can be added to `RoundManager`
- Game constants can be easily modified
- Phase transitions can be updated in one place
- State validation rules can be centralized
- Player validation rules can be centralized
- Round progression rules can be centralized

## Files Modified

1. **`src/server/game/GameManager.ts`** - Main refactoring
2. **`src/server/game/BettingManager.ts`** - New file for betting logic
3. **`src/server/game/GameStateManager.ts`** - New file for game state management
4. **`src/server/game/PlayerManager.ts`** - New file for player operations
5. **`src/server/game/RoundManager.ts`** - New file for round progression and dealer rotation
6. **`src/server/game/__tests__/GameStateManager.test.ts`** - New test file for GameStateManager
7. **`src/server/game/__tests__/PlayerManager.test.ts`** - New test file for PlayerManager
8. **`src/server/game/__tests__/RoundManager.test.ts`** - New test file for RoundManager
9. **`src/server/game/__tests__/GameManager.test.ts`** - Updated tests to work with refactored structure

## Next Steps for Further Refactoring

1. ✅ **Extract GameStateManager** - Handle game state transitions and validation
2. ✅ **Extract PlayerManager** - Handle player operations and validation
3. ✅ **Extract RoundManager** - Handle round progression and dealer rotation
4. **Create GameEventEmitter** - Centralize all Socket.IO emissions
5. **Add TypeScript interfaces** - Define contracts between managers
6. **Add comprehensive unit tests** - Test each manager independently

## Code Quality Improvements

- Reduced method complexity
- Eliminated code duplication
- Improved single responsibility principle adherence
- Better dependency injection pattern
- Centralized configuration management

# GameManager Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The `GameManager` class was refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability by extracting responsibilities into focused classes and removing code duplication.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Extracted Constants**

- Created `GAME_CONSTANTS` object to centralize magic numbers
- Extracted `PHASE_TRANSITIONS` configuration for better maintainability
- Constants include: `ANTE_AMOUNT`, `CONTINUE_COST`, `CARDS_PER_HAND`, `ROUND_END_DELAY_MS`

### 2. **Created BettingManager Class**

- Extracted all betting-related logic into a separate `BettingManager` class
- Moved methods: `startBettingPhase`, `handleBettingPhaseCompletion`, `getNextPlayerToAct`, `validateBettingAction`, `continuePlaying`, `fold`
- Improved separation of concerns and testability

### 3. **Extracted Game Creation Logic**

- Created `createNewGame()` method to handle game initialization
- Created `createPlayer()` method to handle player creation
- Reduced complexity in `joinGame()` method

### 4. **Improved Code Organization**

- Removed duplicate phase transition configuration
- Updated all methods to use constants instead of magic numbers
- Delegated betting operations to `BettingManager`

## Benefits

### **Maintainability**

- Constants are centralized and easy to modify
- Betting logic is isolated and can be tested independently
- Game creation logic is reusable

### **Testability**

- `BettingManager` can be unit tested in isolation
- Smaller, focused methods are easier to test
- Dependencies are clearly defined

### **Readability**

- Methods are shorter and more focused
- Constants make the code self-documenting
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Extensibility**

- New betting features can be added to `BettingManager`
- Game constants can be easily modified
- Phase transitions can be updated in one place

## Files Modified

1. **`src/server/game/GameManager.ts`** - Main refactoring
2. **`src/server/game/BettingManager.ts`** - New file for betting logic

## Next Steps for Further Refactoring

1. **Extract GameStateManager** - Handle game state transitions and validation
2. **Extract PlayerManager** - Handle player operations and validation
3. **Extract RoundManager** - Handle round progression and dealer rotation
4. **Create GameEventEmitter** - Centralize all Socket.IO emissions
5. **Add TypeScript interfaces** - Define contracts between managers
6. **Add comprehensive unit tests** - Test each manager independently

## Code Quality Improvements

- Reduced method complexity
- Eliminated code duplication
- Improved single responsibility principle adherence
- Better dependency injection pattern
- Centralized configuration management
